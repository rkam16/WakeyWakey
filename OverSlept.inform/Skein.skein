You slowly peel your eyes open to be met by the blinding midday light. The bones in your back crackle and pop as you attempt to sit up. It takes you a moment to orient yourself in this unfamiliar enviorment. It&apos;s time to find out what you&apos;ve missed.

WakeyWakey
An Interactive Fiction by Riley Kam
Release 1 / Serial number 141007 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Bedroom
A nice comfy bedroom with a nice skylight sitting directly over the bed. A pile of dirty clothes lay clumped in a pile on the floor. A lone dresser with a mirror resides across from the bed. To the east is the Study. To the south is the kitchen.

You can see a velvet door here.

Don&apos;t take sleep pills just to escape the stress of dealing with her. She&apos;s quite a lively one so if you leave her alone she may mess with you and our precious house.

Bedroom
A nice comfy bedroom with a nice skylight sitting directly over the bed. A pile of dirty clothes lay clumped in a pile on the floor. A lone dresser with a mirror resides across from the bed. To the east is the Study. To the south is the kitchen.

You can see a velvet door here.

Kitchen room
 What remains of this modest kitchen is what appears to be a war zone. It seems as though little Sally went on a rampage. There is a large white freezer plugged in right next to the sink. What seems to be a kitchenware drawer is open. To the North is the Bedroom, to the South is Sally&apos;s Room.  

You can see a velvet door here.

Sally&apos;s Room
The Room is reminiscent of your sister&apos;s room back when you were kids. There is a large glass window framed above a small pink bed. The smell of rotten flesh emanates from the easy bake oven. The Kitchen is North.
