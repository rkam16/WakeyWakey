Don&apos;t take sleep pills just to escape the stress of dealing with her. She&apos;s quite a lively one so if you leave her alone she may mess with you and our precious house. Thanks for the Solid and see you soon. -From, Ann P.S If you do pass out and are reading this message for the first time, (to your knowledge), then go to the file cabinet and open it using, I Suck, as the password

Kitchen room
 What remains of this modest kitchen is what appears to be a war zone. It seems as though little Sally went on a rampage. There is a large white freezer plugged in right next to the sink. What seems to be a kitchenware drawer is open. To the North is the Bedroom, to the South is Sally&apos;s Room.  

You can see a velvet door here.

Sally&apos;s Room
The Room is reminiscent of your sister&apos;s room back when you were kids. There is a large glass window framed above a small pink bed. The smell of rotten flesh emanates from the easy bake oven. The Kitchen is North.

Kitchen room
 What remains of this modest kitchen is what appears to be a war zone. It seems as though little Sally went on a rampage. There is a large white freezer plugged in right next to the sink.

Sally&apos;s Room
The Room is reminiscent of your sister&apos;s room back when you were kids. There is a large glass window framed above a small pink bed. The smell of rotten flesh emanates from the easy bake oven. The Kitchen is North.

Sally&apos;s Room
The Room is reminiscent of your sister&apos;s room back when you were kids. There is a large glass window framed above a small pink bed. The smell of rotten flesh emanates from the easy bake oven. The Kitchen is North.

Kitchen room
 What remains of this modest kitchen is what appears to be a war zone. It seems as though little Sally went on a rampage. There is a large white freezer plugged in right next to the sink. What seems to be a kitchenware drawer is open. To the North is the Bedroom, to the South is Sally&apos;s Room.  

You can see a velvet door here.
